# C_Compiler_Project
A compiler is a software program that transforms high-level source code that is written by a developer in a high-level programming language into a low level object code (binary code) in machine language, which can be understood by the processor.

## Phases of Compiler
The compilation process is a sequence of various phases. Each phase takes input from previous stage, has its own representation of source program and feeds its output to the next phase of the compiler.
